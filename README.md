# SnapCycle

SnapCycle is an app my friends Sion, Sid, and I created in 2020 during the hackathon CruzHacks. It is an app that uses machine learning to detect what type of material an object is made of and if it is recyclable. It was created using Swift v5 and works with iOS 8-14. This app is unmaintained.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need an up to date version of Xcode with Swift v5 capabilities

```
git clone https://github.com/WillHord/SnapCycle.git
```

### Installing

To install and test the app, open the project in Xcode. You will then need to go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab and select your team. You may then build the app in a simulator or install it on your phone.
